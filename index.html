<p>A one repetition maximum (often abbreviated 1RM) identifies a weight that a weight lifter can lift only once for a given movement, such as the bench press. This value is often calculated based on strength testing where the lifter lifts a sub-maximal weight for as many repetitions as possible.</p>

<p>It turns out that there are a number of different ways to calculate a 1RM, as depicted on Wikipedia: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-repetition_maximum">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-repetition_maximum</a>. <em>onerepmax-js</em> simply compiles these formulas into a JavaScript library. In addition to the seven formulas listed in the Wikipedia entry, <em>onerepmax-js</em> also provides functionality to average all of the formulas as well as return an object containing the results of all the formulas using a single set of test data.</p>

<h2>
<a id="usage" class="anchor" href="#usage" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Usage</h2>

<p>To use <em>onerepmax-js</em>, use your favorite means of including the source code into your project or webpage. When the script is executed, a global object called onerepmax will be created. It is through this object that the calculations will be performed.</p>

<p>onerepmax contains 7 methods that are direct implementations of a specific 1RM formula (as taken from Wikipedia). The method names are based on the formulas they implement. Each of these direct formula methods take the same input:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>weight</strong>: a number greater than 0 that represents the weight lifted for strength testing. There is no upper bound.</li>
<li>
<strong>reps</strong>: a number greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10 that represents the number of times the weight was lifted during testing.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here is an example of each direct formula method call:</p>

<pre><code>var orm = onerepmax.brzycki(135, 10);
var orm = onerepmax.epley(135, 10);
var orm = onerepmax.lander(135, 10);
var orm = onerepmax.lombardi(135, 10);
var orm = onerepmax.mayhew(135, 10);
var orm = onerepmax.oconner(135, 10);
var orm = onerepmax.wathen(135, 10);
</code></pre>

<p>When invalid arguments are passed into these methods (see the descriptions for <strong>weight</strong> and <strong>reps</strong> above), the methods will return -1.</p>

<p>onerepmax contains two additional methods that aim to make the 7 formula methods a bit more useful. These two methods are:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>average</strong>: returns an average of the 7 formula methods</li>
<li>
<strong>all</strong>: returns an object containing the results of the 7 formula methods and the average method.</li>
</ul>

<p>These two methods expect the same parameters as the 7 formula methods. Likewise, when invalid arguments are passed to the average method, -1 will be returned. When invalid arguments are passed to the all method, an empty object will be returned.</p>

<p>Here are example calls to these two methods:</p>

<pre><code>var orm = onerepmax.average(135, 10);
var allOrms = onerepmax.all(135, 10);
</code></pre>
